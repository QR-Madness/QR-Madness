# WhoAmI?

I'm a very passionate software engineer dedicated to the delivery of altruistic solutions to critical issues.

# Specializations

I work primarily with cloud technologies and highly networked systems.
My preferred style of architecture is decoupling services and focusing on integrations rather than dependencies,
speaking abstractly.
